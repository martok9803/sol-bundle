## üß© Overview

**Solana Multi-Wallet Trader** is a fast and minimalistic CLI tool for automated multi-wallet trading on **Solana**.  
It seamlessly handles **Pump.fun** token launches and **Jupiter** swaps, automatically detecting the optimal route for each trade.

All operations happen **locally** ‚Äî the app derives and signs every transaction on your machine using a single mnemonic seed phrase.  
No browser extensions. No third-party servers. No external key handling.

## ‚ú≥Ô∏è Features

### üîë Deterministic Wallet Generation
- Derive up to **20 sub-wallets** from a single 12-word mnemonic.

### üí∞ Funding Tools
- Equal split from main wallet (keep a reserve and distribute the rest).  
- Fixed SOL per wallet or wallet range.  
- One-off manual transfers.  
- Sweep SOL back to main (configurable fee buffer).  
- Hidden transfer: main ‚Üí external wallet.

### ‚öîÔ∏è Trading Automation
- Buy or sell across **all** or **selected** wallets.  
- Choose **fixed**, **custom**, or **max** spend mode.  
- Sell a percentage or full balance per wallet.  
- Auto-detects **Pump.fun** bonding curve or falls back to **Jupiter**.

### üöÄ Submission Flexibility
- Integrates **Jito bundling** with optional tip support.  
- Gracefully falls back to standard RPC if Jito is unavailable.

### üß± Failsafe Design
- Local-only mnemonic and signing.  
- Adjustable rate limiting (respects RPC quotas).  
- Configurable transaction speed, slippage, and fee buffers.

## üß† How It Works

1. **Wallet Derivation**  
   Reads your mnemonic from `.env` and derives multiple Solana keypairs using BIP-44 (`m/44'/501'/i'/0'`).  
   - Index `0` ‚Üí Main wallet  
   - Indices `1‚Äì20` ‚Üí Sub-wallets  

2. **Routing Logic**  
   - If Pump.fun bonding curve PDA is live ‚Üí executes Pump.fun instructions directly.  
   - Otherwise ‚Üí uses Jupiter REST API to build and sign a routed swap.  

3. **Transaction Sending**  
   - If Jito is configured, bundles up to 4 transactions with optional tips.  
   - Automatically falls back to standard RPC with throttling if needed.  

4. **Signing & Safety**  
   - All signing happens locally ‚Äî your mnemonic never leaves your machine.  
   - Optional micro-tips improve transaction inclusion via Jito.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration (`.env`)

Below is a sample `.env` file.  
You can copy it from `.env.example` and modify it with your keys and wallet info.

---

```bash
# --- WALLET CONFIG ---
MNEMONIC="your twelve seed words here"

# --- RPC (Helius recommended) ---
RPC_URL="https://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_KEY"
WS_URL="wss://mainnet.helius-rpc.com/?api-key=YOUR_KEY"

# --- JITO (optional) ---
JITO_URL="ny.mainnet.block-engine.jito.wtf"
TIP_LAMPORTS=1000000                # 0.001 SOL tip (set 0 to disable)

# --- BOT DEFAULTS ---
NUM_SUB_WALLETS=20
SLIPPAGE_BPS=100                    # 1%
FEE_BUFFER_SOL=0.003
MIN_SPEND_SOL=0.0005
SEND_TXS_PER_SEC=1                  # 1 = free RPC, up to 5 for paid

# --- ROUTING PREFERENCES ---
USE_PUMPFUN_FIRST=1                 # 1 = try Pump.fun first
FORCE_RPC=0                         # 1 = skip Jito completely

# --- HIDDEN TRANSFER (Main ‚Üí External) ---
EXTERNAL_WALLET="your_main_wallet_here"
EXTERNAL_FEE_RESERVE_SOL=0.0005

```

##ü™ô Example Workflows

‚û§ Fund Wallets

Equal Split: Distribute remaining SOL evenly after reserving a buffer (e.g., 0.1 SOL).

Fixed Amount: Send specific SOL per wallet or wallet range.

Sweep Back: Reclaim leftover SOL from sub-wallets to MAIN.

‚û§ Buy Tokens

Execute buys from all or selected wallets.

Use fixed or ‚Äúmax‚Äù modes.

Automatically chooses Pump.fun or Jupiter based on availability.

‚û§ Sell Tokens

Sell a percentage (e.g., 25%) or 100% across all wallets.

Routing handled automatically.
